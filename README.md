# ReadmeGenerator

## Description
In this project I use the npm package Inquirer to build automatically build a README.md file for a user by collecting their input in the terminal and using it to fill out the 
contents of the README. The auto-generated README.md file has a Table of Contents which links to the appropriate parts of the README, a license badge next to the project title
that corresponds with the type of license the user has chosen, and links to the user's GitHub page.
